## What is Granitecode
Granitecode is an AI-powered code assistant built using **Granite models** — high-quality, actively developed [models from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/granite) that are truly open and free. Unlike proprietary AI coding assistants, **Granite models can be downloaded and run locally**, ensuring that you get the benefits of AI-assisted coding while maintaining **full privacy**.

The first implementation of Granitecode is a **VS Code extension**, but with the support of the open-source community, we hope to expand it to other IDEs, including **Vim and Emacs**.

## Features
- **Setup Wizard:** Guides users through downloading and installing **Ollama** and the **Granite model**.
- **Automatic Model Selection & Updates:** Ensures users always have the latest models.
- **Streamlined UI:** Optimized for coding assistance.

## How to Get Granitecode
You can get **Granitecode** from the following sources:
- **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Granite-Code)** – Full source code and development updates.
- **[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.granitecode)** – Download the prebuilt extension.
