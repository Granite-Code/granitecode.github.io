<h1>Welcome to the temporary homepage of Granite.code!</h1>
<p><img src="granitecodelogo.png" align="right">
<p>Welcome to the homepage of the Granite.code project. This is an open source project to create a Artificial Intelligence assistant using the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/granite">Granite AI models from IBM</a>.</p>
<p>So why the Granite models you ask? Well the Granite models are high quality and actively developed models from IBM which also are truly open and free.
The Granite models are downloadable and you can run them on your own computer, which means you can get the advantages of a AI Code Assistant, while also protecting 
your privacy.</p>
<p>
The initial version of Granite.code is an extension for the popular VS Code IDE, but over time and with the help of the wider open source community we hope to see it supported
in other IDEs too, even Vi and Emacs!</p>
</p>

<h2>Current features</h2>
<ul>
<li>A setup wizard that guides the user through downloading and installing Ollama and the Granite model.</li>
<li>Granite models are automatically selected, and updated as new models are released.</li>
<li>The UI is tweaked and streamlined for the specific use case.</li>
<li>Branding is changed to distinguish our extension.</li>
</ul>    

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/Granite-Code">full sourcecode for Granite.code here on Github</a>.</p>

<p>The premade <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.granitecode">Granite.code extension</a> can be downloaded through the VS Code Marketplace
